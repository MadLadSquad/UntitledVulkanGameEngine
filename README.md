> Last stable release: 0.7.2.5

> Current code version: 0.7.3.0

> Currently stable on: Linux, BSD and Windows

> Development status: Under heavy construction, we commit directly to master so there will be and possibly are countless bugs in the current master branch
## Information
The UntitledVulkanGameEngine is a 3D game engine written in C++. It uses Vulkan and Modern OpenGL as graphics APIs and has a simple and easy to use C++ scripting API. The engine follows the Gentoo philosophy which means that everything is compiled by the user, no binaries needed. We also support multiple platforms like Linux, MacOS and BSD.

## Q&A
Q: It's called the UntitledVulkanEngine but where is the Vulkan renderer

A: The vulkan renderer is going to be built in the future because we are first trying to lay out solid foundations so we can add it without serious problems
